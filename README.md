# üåä FD-YOLOv8: Enhanced YOLOv8 for Floating Object Detection on Water Surfaces

FD-YOLOv8 is an improved YOLOv8-based detection framework designed for **robust and precise detection of floating objects on water surfaces**.  
The model enhances YOLOv8n through three key structural modules ‚Äî **SPDConv**, **CSP_DCNv2CoordConv**, and **C2S_Upsample** ‚Äî to address challenges such as small-object loss, reflection interference, and multi-scale feature degradation.

## üîç Overview

Floating debris such as plastic, glass, and metal severely threaten aquatic ecosystems and urban water management.  
FD-YOLOv8 improves detection accuracy and robustness in dynamic water environments by introducing:

- **SPDConv**: Enhances contextual feature extraction and discrimination between visually similar debris (e.g., plastic vs. glass).  
- **CSP_DCNv2CoordConv**: Strengthens spatial localization and adapts to illumination, glare, and deformation.  
- **C2S_Upsample**: Refines upsampling for better small-object perception and high-frequency detail preservation.

| Plastic | Bottles, containers, films |
| Glass | Transparent bottles, fragments |
| Metal | Cans, sheets |
| Wood | Branches, planks |
| Rubber | Tires, fragments |
| Foam | Styrofoam, packing materials |
| Net | Fishing nets, ropes |
| Bag | Plastic and woven bags |

**Composition:**
- Public **Roboflow floating-object dataset**  
- Self-collected images from **Nantong canal gates**  
- Synthetic samples generated using **Stable Diffusion 3**  
- Split ratio: **Train 70% / Val 20% / Test 10%**
