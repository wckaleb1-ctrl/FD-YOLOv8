# 🌊 FD-YOLOv8: Enhanced YOLOv8 for Floating Object Detection on Water Surfaces

FD-YOLOv8 is an improved YOLOv8-based detection framework designed for **robust and precise detection of floating objects on water surfaces**.  
The model enhances YOLOv8n through three key structural modules — **SPDConv**, **CSP_DCNv2CoordConv**, and **C2S_Upsample** — to address challenges such as small-object loss, reflection interference, and multi-scale feature degradation.

## 🔍 Model Overview

To address the challenges of small-object detection, visual similarity, and complex water-surface disturbances, our model introduces three key structural improvements based on YOLOv8n — forming the **FD-YOLOv8 architecture**:

### 1️⃣ SPDConv Module (Sparse and Dynamic Convolution)
Enhances contextual feature extraction through multi-branch sparse convolution and adaptive fusion.  
By dynamically weighting different feature branches, SPDConv improves the model’s ability to discriminate between **visually similar debris categories** (e.g., glass vs. plastic bottles) and retains fine-grained details during downsampling.

### 2️⃣ CSP_DCNv2CoordConv Module
Integrates **Deformable Convolution v2 (DCNv2)** and **Coordinate Convolution (CoordConv)** to strengthen **spatial perception and adaptability** under dynamic lighting and wave disturbances.  
This combination allows the model to adjust to irregular object shapes and illumination variations, significantly improving robustness against **glare, ripples, and deformation** on complex water surfaces.

### 3️⃣ C2S_Upsample Module (Channel-to-Spatial Upsample)
Achieves **cross-scale feature fusion** and **super-resolution reconstruction** during upsampling.  
By reorganizing multi-level features and preserving high-frequency information, it enhances detection performance on **small and distant floating objects**, maintaining clear boundaries and high confidence even under multi-angle perspectives.

> Together, these three modules enable FD-YOLOv8 to achieve superior precision, recall, and mAP performance compared to standard YOLOv8n, with improved robustness in small-object detection, reflection suppression, and class discrimination across diverse water environments.
