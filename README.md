# üåä FD-YOLOv8: Enhanced YOLOv8 for Floating Object Detection on Water Surfaces

FD-YOLOv8 is an improved YOLOv8-based detection framework designed for **robust and precise detection of floating objects on water surfaces**.  
The model enhances YOLOv8n through three key structural modules ‚Äî **SPDConv**, **CSP_DCNv2CoordConv**, and **C2S_Upsample** ‚Äî to address challenges such as small-object loss, reflection interference, and multi-scale feature degradation.

## üîç Model Overview

To address the challenges of small-object detection, visual similarity, and complex water-surface disturbances, our model introduces three key structural improvements based on YOLOv8n ‚Äî forming the **FD-YOLOv8 architecture**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SPDConv Module (Sparse and Dynamic Convolution)
Enhances contextual feature extraction through multi-branch sparse convolution and adaptive fusion.  
By dynamically weighting different feature branches, SPDConv improves the model‚Äôs ability to discriminate between **visually similar debris categories** (e.g., glass vs. plastic bottles) and retains fine-grained details during downsampling.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CSP_DCNv2CoordConv Module
Integrates **Deformable Convolution v2 (DCNv2)** and **Coordinate Convolution (CoordConv)** to strengthen **spatial perception and adaptability** under dynamic lighting and wave disturbances.  
This combination allows the model to adjust to irregular object shapes and illumination variations, significantly improving robustness against **glare, ripples, and deformation** on complex water surfaces.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ C2S_Upsample Module (Channel-to-Spatial Upsample)
Achieves **cross-scale feature fusion** and **super-resolution reconstruction** during upsampling.  
By reorganizing multi-level features and preserving high-frequency information, it enhances detection performance on **small and distant floating objects**, maintaining clear boundaries and high confidence even under multi-angle perspectives.

> Together, these three modules enable FD-YOLOv8 to achieve superior precision, recall, and mAP performance compared to standard YOLOv8n, with improved robustness in small-object detection, reflection suppression, and class discrimination across diverse water environments.

## üåç Overview

Floating debris such as plastic, glass, and metal severely threaten aquatic ecosystems and urban water management.  
FD-YOLOv8 improves detection accuracy and robustness in dynamic water environments by introducing:

- **SPDConv**: Enhances contextual feature extraction and discrimination between visually similar debris (e.g., plastic vs. glass).  
- **CSP_DCNv2CoordConv**: Strengthens spatial localization and adapts to illumination, glare, and deformation.  
- **C2S_Upsample**: Refines upsampling for better small-object perception and high-frequency detail preservation.
